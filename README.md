# SQL
## Project 1:
  ### Creating Database
  The start of this project is to create a completely new database. This inccludes creating schemas, tables, and inserting data into the database. It also includes optimization techniques to optimize queries.



  ### Scope of the Database
 The purpose of this database is to efficiently manage and track employee information, daily attendance records, and monthly payroll details within an organization. It is designed to automate HR operations such as monitoring presence or absence, calculating payrolls based on attendance and salary data, and organizing employees by departments. This helps reduce manual errors, increase operational transparency, and generate accurate reports for administrative decision-making.
   
**Included in this database's scope is:**
* _Employees: Personal information, job position, department affiliation, salary, and hire date_.
* _Departments: Organizational units where employees are assigned_.
* _Attendance records: Daily logs of whether employees were present, absent, or on leave_.
* _Payroll: Monthly salary disbursements based on employee data and attendance_.
* _HR/Administrative staff: Users who will interact with the system for data entry and report generation_.

Out of the scope are: Freelance workers, tax computations, employee performance evaluation, and multi-location (this model only assumes single-location setup)
